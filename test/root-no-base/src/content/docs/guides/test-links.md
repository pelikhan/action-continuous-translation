title: Test Guide with Links
description: A test guide to verify link patching is working correctly.
---

This is a test page to verify that links are patched correctly.

Here are some test links:
- [Public asset](../../../../../public/favicon.svg)
- [Another public asset](../../../../../public/test.png)
- [Directory link](../../../../../public/)
- [Relative link](./example.md)

These links should be correctly patched to use the right number of `../` levels.
