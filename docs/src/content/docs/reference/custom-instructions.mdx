You can inject custom prompting instructions for the translation task.
This can be used to insert additional instructions, glossary or other guidance to improve
the overall translation quality.

## Inline instructions

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ct.yml" "instructions: Use a casual tone."
uses: pelikhan/action-continuous-translation@v0
with:
  instructions: Use a casual tone.
```

## Instructions from a file

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ct.yml" "instructions_file: ./instructions.txt"
uses: pelikhan/action-continuous-translation@v0
with:
  instructions_file: ./instructions.txt
```

## Instructions in frontmatter

You can also specify translation instructions directly in the frontmatter of individual documents.
This is useful when different documents require specific translation approaches.

```markdown title="example.md"
---
title: "My Document"
translator:
  instructions: |
    Use formal tone and preserve all technical terms in English.
---

# My Document Content

This document will be translated using the instructions specified in the frontmatter.
```

The `translator` object is a [configuration](/action-continuous-translation/reference/configuration) instance and validated at runtime.

## Priority Order

Instructions are applied in the following priority order:

1. `instructions` parameter (highest priority)
2. `instructions_file` parameter
3. `translator.instructions` from document frontmatter (lowest priority)

If multiple methods are used, only the highest priority one will be applied.
