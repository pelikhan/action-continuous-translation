You can inject custom prompting instructions for the translation task.
This can be used to insert additional instructions, glossary or other guidance to improve
the overall translation quality.

- inline instructions

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ct.yml" "instructions: Use a casual tone."
uses: pelikhan/action-continuous-translation@v0
with:
  instructions: Use a casual tone.
```

- instructions from a file

```yaml title=".github/workflows/ct.yml" "instructions_file: ./instructions.txt"
uses: pelikhan/action-continuous-translation@v0
with:
  instructions_file: ./instructions.txt
```

- instructions in document frontmatter

You can also specify translation instructions directly in the frontmatter of individual documents. This is useful when different documents require specific translation approaches.

```markdown title="example.md"
---
title: "My Document"
translatorInstructions: "Use formal tone and preserve all technical terms in English."
---

# My Document Content

This document will be translated using the instructions specified in the frontmatter.
```

Alternative field name:

```markdown title="example.md"
---
title: "My Document"  
translator_instructions: "Use casual tone and localize all examples."
---

# My Document Content
```

:::note[Priority Order]
Instructions are applied in the following priority order:
1. `instructions` parameter (highest priority)
2. `instructions_file` parameter
3. `translatorInstructions` or `translator_instructions` from document frontmatter (lowest priority)

If multiple methods are used, only the highest priority one will be applied.
